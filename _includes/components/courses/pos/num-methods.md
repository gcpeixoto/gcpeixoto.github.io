### Numerical Methods (SEMEC0140)
---

This course is fully based on variational methods as introductory topic for application of CFD with the finite element method. In the current version, it is a 3-part course divided as follows:

- **Part 1 (Tools)**: A general overview on numerical methods, basics on Python programming, and presentation of tools like Scipy ecosystem, solvers (FENICS, OpenFOAM etc.), mesh generators (meshio, Gmsh etc.), CAE/CAD open platforms, viewers (Paraview, Mayavi etc.) and support literature.
- **Part 2 (Theory)**: Discussion of approximation theory, construction principles of FEM, topics on functional analysis, strong/weak form, n-dimensional IBVPs.
- **Part 3 (Practice)**: project-based learning oriented to student's research (generally CFD or multiphysics simulations with Gmsh/FENICS/Paraview trio), and state-of-the-art approaches.

#### Resources 

Remark: resources for this course can be forked from GDCOC0072.

	- _Takeaways_: i) may improve convergence speed; ii) fewer optimization steps; iii) generalization for spatial variability.
	- _Gaps:_ non-linearity solvable through training; PDE solvers not optimized for large batch training on GPU; iii) FEM weak form requires efficient quadrature integration over the NN, whose rules are unknown for now.
