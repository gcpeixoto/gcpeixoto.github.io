### Topics on Reservoir Modeling (SEMEC0202)
---

- This course is based on the [MRST Toolbox](https://www.sintef.no/projectweb/mrst/) and on the book [An Introduction to Reservoir Simulation Using MATLAB/GNU Octave:  User Guide for the MATLAB Reservoir Simulation Toolbox (MRST)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/an-introduction-to-reservoir-simulation-using-matlabgnu-octave/F48C3D8C88A3F67E4D97D4E16970F894), by K-A Lie. I cover the gist of the reservoir modelling workflow with focus on black-oil simulations.
