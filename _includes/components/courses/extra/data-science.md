- I lectured this course in partnership with Dr. Andrea Rocha remotely during 2020. Our purpose was to introduce basic Mathematics and Statistics concepts to newcomers of our Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Program through Python language.
- The basic materials for the course can be accessed through the interactive book on [https://gcpeixoto.github.io/FMECD](https://gcpeixoto.github.io/FMECD)
