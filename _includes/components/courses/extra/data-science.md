### Fundamentals of Math and Statistics for Data Science
---

- I lectured this course in partnership with Dr. Andrea Rocha remotely during 2020. Our purpose was to introduce basic Math and Stats concepts to students of our [new Baccaulaureate in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence](http://cdia.ci.ufpb.br) through Python language.
- The basic materials for the course can be accessed through the interactive book on [https://gcpeixoto.github.io/FMECD](https://gcpeixoto.github.io/FMECD)
