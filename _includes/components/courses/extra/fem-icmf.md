- I was invited by the [VIR2AL](http://2phaseflow.org) committee to participate in the _4th Workshop on Advances in CFD, LB and MD Modeling of Capillary Two-Phase Flows and Experimental Validation_, before [ICMF 2019](http://www.icmf2019.com.br) with a talk about introductory ALE/FEM approach for two-phase flows along with [Dr. Gustavo Anjos](https://gustavorabello.github.io) and Dr. Norberto Mangiavacchi.
