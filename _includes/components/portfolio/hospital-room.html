            This figure illustrates a horizontal cross-section through the rooms of a healthcare unit.
            Uniformly spaced sampling points are distributed across each compartment to collect data at a height of 1.5 meters above the floor - the reference level required by Brazilian ANVISA regulations for evaluating the velocity field.
        </p>
        <p>
            Violin plots depict the distribution density of air velocity for three scenarios: no filtering, and the use of 1-inch and 2-inch MERV-13 filters integrated into the air-conditioning system as contaminant control measures.
