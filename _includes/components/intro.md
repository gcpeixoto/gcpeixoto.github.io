## About me

Hello!

Currently, I'm an adjunct professor at the Federal University of Paraíba, located in the beautiful seashore João Pessoa city, where  lies the Brazil's far east point. My predominant research areas cover numerical methods, fluid mechanics, and scientific computing. In particular, I sail amidst finite elements, multiphase flows, numerical analysis, computer programming, porous media, reservoir modeling, and artificial intelligence applications. 

Although I've held a bit of math in my innermost roots, I've tasted several mechanics' syrups over the years and now I have a passionate vision of certain disciplines, such as transport phenomena and fluid mechanics. Well, I'd say that it's a small lily in a large garden, wherein I'm used to plow. In short words, my field of study is [Computational Science and Engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_engineering).

After receiving my undergraduate diploma in Mathematics, I've escaped towards Metallurgical and Materials Engineering for a while. My master's degree was on top of hydrodynamic stability, rotating disk, von Kármán and all that. In the mids of my doctoral journey, I moved to Lausanne, Switzerland, for an internship time, where I stayed diving into the seas of multiphase flows and their numerical modeling. Back in Brazil, I've received my doctoral degree in Mechanical Engineering with a thesis talking about the motion of a drop jet subject to crossflow. Later on, I began a post-doc in hemodynamics and another in mathematical modeling to collect some expertise. A few years later... here I am. 

This webpage was developed to show my career portfolio, gather useful technical information in my toolbox pages and provide links to third-party stuff, such as profiles of coworkers and interesting people. I hope you like to be here! :) 

Don't hesitate to contact me if you realize I can help you with something.

Nice stay and best regards!

G.P.O.
