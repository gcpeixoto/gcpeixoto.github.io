## About me

Hello!

Currently, I'm an adjunct professor at the Federal University of Paraíba (UFPB), located in the beautiful seashore João Pessoa city – where lies the Brazil's far east point – and one of the creators of [TRIL Lab](https://tril.ci.ufpb.br). After many waves, river wakes, and mixtures revolve the life, I'd say that my field of study is [Computational Science and Engineering - CSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_engineering), where I conserve an interdisciplinary and breadth-like profile covering numerical methods, scientific computing, mechanical sciences, and data _SAVE_ (sciance, analytics, visualization, and engineering).

Several subjects form my past experience, such as finite elements, transport phenomena, multiphase flows, numerical analysis, porous media, and reservoir modeling. More recently, I have been focused on CSE for energy, such as carbon capture, storage, and utilization (CCUS).

This webpage was developed to show my career portfolio, gather useful technical information in my toolbox pages, thoughts, and provide links to third-party stuff, such as profiles of coworkers and interesting people. I hope you like to be here! :) 

Don't hesitate to contact me if you realize I can help you with something.

Nice stay and best regards!

G.P.O.

#### Afterwords

> *“And wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times, and strength of salvation: the fear of the Lord is his treasure.”* The Holy Bible, Isaiah 33:6, apud: Introduction to Hydrodynamic Stability, by P. G. Drazin.

> *"Let my teaching drop as the rain, my speech distill as the dew, as the droplets on the fresh grass and as the showers on the herb."* (The Song of Moses), The Holy Bible, Deuteronomy 32:2, apud: "Drop Jet in Crossflow: ALE/Finite Element Simulations and Interfacial Effects. GPO's thesis.

> *"God has hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge in Christ. I say this so that no one will mislead you with arguments that merely sound good."* (Letter to Colossians 2:2-4)

> *"In the beginning was the [Λόγος], and the [Λόγος] was with God, and the [Λόγος] was God."* (Book of John 1:1)

>*"I have observed something else under the sun. The fastest runner doesn’t always win the race, and the strongest warrior doesn’t always win the battle. The wise sometimes go hungry, and the skillful are not necessarily wealthy. And those who are educated don’t always lead successful lives. It is all decided by chance, by being in the right place at the right time."* (Ecclesiastes 9:11; NLT)
