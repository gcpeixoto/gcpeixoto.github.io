## About me

Hello!

Currently, I'm an adjunct professor at the Federal University of Paraíba (UFPB), located in the beautiful seashore João Pessoa city, where  lies the Brazil's far east point. My predominant research areas cover numerical methods, fluid mechanics, and scientific computing. In a recent past, I sailed amidst finite elements, multiphase flows, numerical analysis, porous media, and reservoir modeling.
More recently, I have been focused on data science applications for energy and healthcare sectors.

Although I've held a bit of math in my innermost roots, I've tasted several mechanics' syrups over the years, so that I acquired a passionate vision of certain disciplines, such as transport phenomena and fluid mechanics. Today, after many waves, river wakes, and mixtures revolve the life, I'd say that my field of study is [Computational Science and Engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_engineering), where I conserve an interdisciplinary and breadth-like scientific profile.

This webpage was developed to show my career portfolio, gather useful technical information in my toolbox pages and provide links to third-party stuff, such as profiles of coworkers and interesting people. I hope you like to be here! :) 

Don't hesitate to contact me if you realize I can help you with something.

Nice stay and best regards!

G.P.O.

#### Afterwords

> *“And wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times, and strength of salvation: the fear of the Lord is his treasure.”* The Holy Bible, Isaiah 33:6, apud: Introduction to Hydrodynamics Stability, by P. G. Drazin.

> *"Let my teaching drop as the rain, my speech distill as the dew, as the droplets on the fresh grass and as the showers on the herb."* (The Song of Moses), The Holy Bible, Deuteronomy 32:2, apud: "Drop Jet in Crossflow: ALE/Finite Element Simulations and Interfacial Effects. GPO's thesis.

> *"God has hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge in Christ. I say this so that no one will mislead you with arguments that merely sound good."* (Letter to Colossians 2:2-4)

> *"In the beginning was the [Λόγος], and the [Λόγος] was with God, and the [Λόγος] was God."* (Book of John 1:1)

>*"I have observed something else under the sun. The fastest runner doesn’t always win the race, and the strongest warrior doesn’t always win the battle. The wise sometimes go hungry, and the skillful are not necessarily wealthy. And those who are educated don’t always lead successful lives. It is all decided by chance, by being in the right place at the right time."* (Ecclesiastes 9:11; NLT)
