Hello!

Currently, I'm an adjunct professor at the Department of Scientific Computing - Federal University of Paraíba ([Center of Informatics](www.ci.ufpb.br)) and researcher at LaMEP ([Petroleum Engineering Modeling Laboratory](www.lamep.ci.ufpb.br)).

Some of my research areas and interest include finite element, multiphase flows, numerical analysis, computer programming, porous media and reservoir modeling. Although I've held a bit of math in my innermost roots, I've tasted several mechanics' syrups over the years and now I have a passionate vision of certain disciplines, such as transport phenomena and fluid mechanics. Well, I'd say that it's a small lily in a large garden, wherein I'm used to plowing.

After receiving my undergraduate diploma in Mathematics, I've escaped towards Metallurgy and Materials Engineering for a while. My master's degree was on top of hydrodynamic stability, rotating disk, von Kármán and all that. In the mids of my doctoral journey, I moved to Lausanne, Switzerland, for an internship time, where I stayed diving into the seas of multiphase flows and their numerical modeling. Back in Brazil, I've received my doctoral degree in Mechanical Engineering with a thesis talking about the motion of a drop jet subject to crossflow. Later on, I began a post-doc in hemodynamics and another in mathematical modeling to collect some expertise. A few years later... here I am. 

This webpage was developed to show you my career portfolio, gather useful technical information in my toolbox pages and provide links to third-parties, such as coworkers and interesting people. I hope you like to be here! :) 

Don't hesitate to contact me if you realize I can help you with something.

Nice stay and best regards!

G.P.O.
